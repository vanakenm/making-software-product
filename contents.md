---

### I speak very fast

## but you can interrupt me

---

### I have a weird english accent

## I hope it's funny too

---

> I'm currently renovating my house. Discussions with the entrepreneur are difficult

* For me, this is my whole life - for him it's just a small project
* He's being doing that for 15 years - that's the first and probably last time for me

---

### I've been developing software for the last 15 years

## I'm from the other side. I'm here to help.

---

## Agenda

1.  Defining your product
2.  Finding developers
3.  Getting software done

--

# 1. Defining your product

Note:
This is not about software.

---

## What do you need to know before starting a business &#9072;

Note:
Let's ask the audience & note what they say
Among the things: I don't care about your market size if you can't explain to me how you are getting them... and there is no problem with making a business for a niche - not everyone needs to build a 1000 people company

---

## About 💡

* We talk a lot about ideas
* How to protect them
* How valuable their are

---

### The reality

> "Nobody is going to steal your shitty idea"

> Adeo Ressi

---

### They are not so valuable

* They are only about the solution
* They will probably change
* Execution matter much more

---

### You should talk more than protect them

* Get feedback
* You are not your idea
* It won't help anyway

---

![plan](images/businessplan.jpg)

---

## In the beginning

* An audience
* with a problem
* that is valuable and possible to solve

---

## Identify the audience

![audience](images/audience.jpg)

---

### Some bad examples

* "This is for everyone"
* "We have three types of customers"

Note:
The closest thing I know to an "app for everyone" is Facebook. You are not Facebook (and even they started with a quite specific audience)

---

### Some good cases

* Pick an audience you know
* Be careful that **you are not your audience** even if you are **in** your audience

---

### Being specific is good, not bad

* Easier to find ("watering hole")
* More consistent in their problems
* You can't reach "everyone" anyway

---

### My take

The **knowledge of your audience** is the biggest thing you bring as a business founder (much more important than your idea).

Note:
I failed miserably at creating a product for HR (I know nothing about HR)
My current company make software for public health. Our CEO and most of our business people are public health specialists

---

### What is -your- audience &#9072;

---

## Identify the problem

![problem](images/problem.jpg)

---

### Don't jump to solutions

---

### What's your audience problem(s) &#9072;

Note:

* It may not be the one you think
* There may be a bigger one
* Needs to be there AND worth solving

---

### Problem interviews

* 15-30 minutes interviews
* In person or call (avoid surveys)
* 12-15 interviews

---

### Example Script

* Welcome
* Demographics / Ice breaker
* Story
* Problem Ranking
* Today's situation
* Thanks and ask

---

### Efficiency

* 15 times 30 minutes = just **7.5 hours**
* After 6-8, people start repeating themselves.
* That's **very cheap** to validate your business

---

### Added benefits

* Start connecting to your audience
* Create a possible alpha user list

**No reason not to do them.**

---

### Fail fast

> I understand you don't want to hear your idea is bad (or that you are not solving any problem). But let's be honest - if it is actually bad, better to know it as early as possible

---

### What problem are -you- attempting to solve &#9072;

---

## Identify a solution

![solution](images/solution.jpg)

---

### Ask the prospect to dream

* Let's imagine that this is working
* Would it solve your problem?
* Would you pay for it?

---

### Mockups

![mockups](images/mockups.jpg)

---

### Mockups

* Create a story board on paper
* **Play it** before your prospect
* Updating mockup is incredibly **cheap**
* Those will be useful for later anyway

---

## Audience, Problem, Solution

---

### "Elevator Pitch" as a summary

![pitch](images/pitch.jpg)

---

### Example 1

My company, **LeWagon**<br>
is developping **a 9 week coding bootcamp**<br>
to help **entrepreneurs**<br>
to **get their first MVP out**<br>
by **developing it themselves with our coaches help**

---

### Example 2

My company, **Bluesquare**<br>
is developping **Web Applications**<br>
that helps **ministries of health in low income countries**<br>
to **improve the quality of care in health centers**<br>
by **giving them money based on their performance**

---

### Let's try! &#9072;

---

## MVP?

* **Minimal**: not a dream, not even a v1
* **Viable**: able to attract/interest users
* **Product**: providing value (entertainment/productivity/whatever)

---

### What about scaling?

You need to sell to 1000 people before selling to 1 000 000
You need to sell to 1 person before selling to 1000

--

# 2. Finding ~~nemo~~ developers

---

## Technical Cofounders

---

### Startup

A startup is a company whose main product is a software.

---

### Are you looking for a Cofounder? (1)

If you are not ready to let shares go, you’re not looking for a Cofounder - you are looking for a developer but you don’t want to pay.

---

### What about 50%?

I'll be building the software, what are you bringing? (hint: there are a lot of good answers to that question, but "the idea" is not one of them).

As a starting company, your stock is worth basically nothing - in a sector which is rewarding well, this is a difficult situation.

---

### Let's do the math

* 2/3 startup fail (exit value = 0)
* An experienced dev can get 100K€ a year
* The dev get 50% of the shares

For this to work, the expected value after three years need to be around 2M€ - else it's a losing bet

---

### Are you looking for a Cofounder? (2)

If you have defined everything, you’re not looking for a Cofounder - you are looking for a developer but you don’t want to pay.

---

### You are not going to find one

Only 25% of founders are technical. Most of those have ideas themselves they want to make happen.

---

### Summary (1)

> You are competing with other people with ideas - work your pitch. Show your unfair advantage. Think about what would make someone invest her sweat and skills at your company and not someone's else.

---

### Summary (2)

> You can't bet your business on finding a technical cofounder in a specific amount of time

---

## Freelances & Agencies

---

### Pros

* Used to deliver
* Experimented
* Can stop/encore when you want
* Can switch for other skills

---

### Cons

* Hopping between projects
* Expensive (day rate ~ 500€)
* Quickly to 5-10K

---

## General recommandations

Freelances are the safest bet (best value for money to get started) - but they get expensive really fast, which means you need to optimize their time.

--

# 3. Getting Software Done

---

### The Disaster Recipe

* Software is expensive (trust me on that one)
* Business changes
* Business owners are bad at requirements
* Developers are bad at estimations
* Business owners and developers are not speaking the same language

---

### Some statistics

Software costing 15M+ are typically:

* 7% late
* 45% overbudget
* 44% done

[McKinsey Study](http://blogs.gartner.com/mark_mcdonald/2012/10/29/mckinsey-report-highlights-failure-of-large-projects-why-it-is-better-to-be-small-particularly-in-it/)

---

![](images/half-house.jpg)

---

### Size matters

The more complex the software, the biggest problems we get in requirements and estimations.

This is not linear - it's exponential.

---

### Fixed price

* Looks like a good idea
* Almost impossible for all but the simplest (= shortest) project
* Require very detailed specification
* Risky: Who decide if/when it is "done"?
* Risky (2): Who can say it's per the specification or not?

---

### Collaboration vs Contracts (1)

> Remember that every minute spent arguing over who is right is a minute lost for your project. Be sure it's worth it.

---

### Collaboration vs Contracts (2)

> A good contract will at best allow you to get out of a bad situation at a limited cost - it will never by itself make the collaboration better

---

### Collaboration vs Contracts (3)

> One thing you absolutely need is an IP transfer clause - can be pretty simple

---

## What works

* Keep the project small
* Split them into smaller tasks
* Discuss on working software more than requirements
* Every task should have a user-observable result
* Rinse & repeat

---

## User Stories

---

### Definition

* A way to describe a single functionality of your software
* One sentence

---

### Template

As a **user category** I want **given functionality** so I can get **benefit**

---

### Why

* Put the user first
* Observable
* Benefit, not feature oriented

---

### Example 1

> As a **tourist** I want **see a list of flats available in the city I'm going to with their rate & location** so I can **see the one best for my own tastes & price range**

What software/company could this be &#9072;

---

### Example 2

> As a **company owner or freelance** I want **see a list of my unpaid invoices** so I can **get them paid quicker**

What software/company could this be &#9072;

---

## Mockups (again)

---

### What

* Show how the application should look like
* Show the interactions (clicking here leads there)
* It should not be pretty (big boxes are good)

[Great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrV2SZuRPv0)

---

### Why

* Helps a lot understanding the stories
* Give design guidelines
* Much better specification than a long explanation

---

### Inspiration

* Look at existing sites
* Doing things the same way as others helps everyone
* Keep it simple

---

### Mobile

* More mobile than desktop traffic today
* When doing mockups, think about small screens!
* "Mobile first" is actually good: force to limit what you see on a single screen

Note:
Choices are difficult, but they lead to better designs

---

## Short iterations

---

### Setup

* Create a list of stories
* Prioritize them

---

### Progress

* Developer take each story one after the other
* Question are asked when needed (requires collaboration)
* Software is deployed regularly

---

### Demo

* Demo every X days (not after X stories) - X < 10
* Discuss of the stories done, give feedback
* Rinse and repeat

---

### Pros

* Feedback loop is short
* You see (and test!) your software evolving week after week
* Easier to steer the course
* Any misunderstanding will be catched quickly

---

### Cons

* You need to work to create those "small stories"
* You don't have a clear date when the software will be "done"...

Note:
... but you would not have it anyway

---

## Some bad signs

* Your developer is talking in technical terms (setting up a database, validating something, etc)
* You are not seeing a working version of your software on a regular basis

Note:
Real horror story: an entrepreneur in Brussels paid more than 30K to have an app delivered, and had still nothing in his hands 6 months after having started...

---

## We're talking about an MVP

* Doing this will require you to split/axe your initial idea to something much humbler
* Think of it as a first step
* Put users on it, collect their feedback
* Rinse & Repeat

Note:
Better to lose 5-20K than 50K

## Tooling

* [Trello](trello.com) for User Stories follow up
* Pen & Paper for mockups
